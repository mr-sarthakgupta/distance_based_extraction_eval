# Distance Metric for Extraction Attacks

This repository contains experiments with the aim of determining a relation between the distance of an input from the classification boundary of a neural network and its effectiveness as an attack vector for model extraction. Additionally, we also propose a binary search based metric to efficiently approximate the distance of a given sample from the classification boundary.

Currently, MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets are being used for the evaluations.
